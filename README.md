# Brainwave-bot-movement
In this project, we will analyse brainwaves i.e. EEG signals which will hence forth help in movement of the vehicle in the desired direction. We will analyse the pre-processing using MATLAB, using arduino/raspberry pi for integrating movement and finally python for machine learning for accurate movement.
